	<section id="hello">
		<p id="introduction">
			Hey there! I'm <strong>nerometa</strong>. I'm 20 years old,
			currently studying for an Associate Degree (or Diploma) in
			Mechatronics <em>and simultaneously</em> doing Software Developer internship
			since 2022.
		</p>

		<p id="interests">
			My interests are broad, such as DJ'ing and producing music, internet
			privacy, exploring new web development technologies, reading books,
			watching anime, playing Warframe, bullet journaling, speedcubing, a
			touch of local politics and hitting the gym 3 times/week.
		</p>

		<p id="purposes">
			This website exists because I think it's an awesome place to share
			what I learned about software development and reflect some of my
			personal thoughts. Most of my knowledge were from outside of school.
			So, I believe that off-campus education is important and it leads me
			to where I am.
