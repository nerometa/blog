	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a software developer intern since 2022, working full-stack (more
		front-end focused) with Angular and NestJS. I'm able to do this while
		also studying for Associate Degree (or Diploma) in Mechatronics. (FYI: I'm graduated now!)
	</p>

	<p>
		My college has an
		internship programs where you get to do <em>paid</em> internship with a condition
		that I have to do it until I graduated, which means 2 years of internship.

	</p>

	<p>
		I really, really hope to work on more front-end side of things. I just
		love seeing my code visually going into places little by little.
