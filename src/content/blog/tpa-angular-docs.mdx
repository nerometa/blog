## Intro to the roadmap and joining TPA

I'd been aware of the association for a while, but I'd only just applied to become a member before the first TPA Connect event at SBAC. At the time, I was free and felt like I needed to get involved if I wanted to get a job in this field, so I Int for it. At the time, I discovered that the association was developing a roadmap Ibsite. I kept looking at the content, but I couldn't find anything about Angular. Once the missing content meets someone with the right expertise, the guide writing began.


## First Angular guide

I was lucky that I had some Angular data written in Thai from my internship to use as a starting point. My boss suggested putting together a portfolio of sorts (but I didn't end up doing that). So I could use that as a starting point for an introduction. Then I started drafting the topic and writing it. I added images and other parts later on and sent the PR to the repo.

One Sunday morning, I was browsing Facebook as usual and saw that the Angular guide I wrote had been shared by a core maintainer in the association's Facebook group. And it was shared by hundreds of people. He also posted it on his personal Facebook page and it was shared just as much there. This came out of nowhere. I was surprised and pleased to be praised for writing such a detailed guide. I wonder if I'm that detail-oriented?

## Second revised edition 

Following the mini-trend, I read a comment from someone who seemed to have problems upgrading the Angular version (I mean, it really is cumbersome than other frameworks when it comes to upgrading ü§£) and I tried to help them out. It was like I got some feedback on the guide, so I'm making some improvements. This time, I added a small migration guide, added emojis as a QoL for looking up resources, and added new resources that didn't exist yet.
